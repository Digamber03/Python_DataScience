# NumPy Basic Built-in Functions

This notebook provides an introduction to some of the basic built-in functions available in the NumPy library for numerical computing in Python.

## Description

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

This notebook covers essential NumPy built-in functions, including array creation, manipulation, mathematical operations, and more.

## Notebook Contents

1. **Array Creation**: Introduction to various methods for creating NumPy arrays, including `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`, and more.

2. **Array Manipulation**: Techniques for reshaping, stacking, splitting, and joining arrays using functions such as `np.reshape()`, `np.hstack()`, `np.vstack()`, `np.concatenate()`, etc.

3. **Mathematical Functions**: Overview of mathematical functions provided by NumPy for element-wise operations, including arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, etc.

4. **Statistical Functions**: Introduction to statistical functions available in NumPy for computing mean, median, standard deviation, variance, and more.

5. **Linear Algebra Operations**: Overview of linear algebra functions for matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, eigenvalue decomposition, and solving linear equations using NumPy.

## Usage

To run the notebook, you can upload it to an environment that supports Jupyter notebooks, such as Kaggle or Google Colab. Alternatively, you can run it locally on your machine with a Python environment that has NumPy installed.

## Data Sources

This notebook does not require any external datasets. All examples and demonstrations use synthetic data generated within the notebook.
